# Steps in MLOps

Based on my own experience in DBS.

1. **Project Structuring and Workflow Management**:
   - Organize project structure and dependencies:
     - Utilize `Kedro` with `Poetry` for structured project layout and dependency management.
   - Define modular pipelines:
     - Break down ML workflows into modular components for easier management and scalability.
   - Consider advanced distributed computing:
     - Explore tools like `Ray` for efficient parallel execution of ML workflows.

2. **Experiment Tracking and Model Management**:
   - Track experiments:
     - Use `MLflow` to log parameters, metrics, and artifacts during model training.
   - Manage model versions:
     - Maintain a record of different model versions and their performance metrics.
   - Automate model deployments:
     - Use `Airflow` DAG job cycles to automate the deployment process based on predefined criteria.

3. **Containerization and Deployment**:
   - Package models into containers:
     - Utilize `Openshift` Containerization for packaging ML models along with dependencies.
   - Ensure consistency across environments:
     - Deploy containers consistently across development, testing, and production environments.

4. **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
   - Automate testing:
     - Implement automated testing to ensure code quality and reliability.
   - Streamline deployment process:
     - Use `GitLab` CI/CD or `Jenkins` to automate building and deployment of ML pipelines and models.
   - Ensure version control:
     - Maintain version control of ML codebase to track changes and facilitate collaboration using `Bitbucket` or `GitLab`.

5. **Exposing Model as an Endpoint**:
   - Develop APIs:
     - Use frameworks like `Django`, `FastAPI`, or `Flask` to expose ML models as RESTful APIs.
   - Handle incoming requests:
     - Implement logic to handle incoming inference requests and return predictions.
   - Ensure scalability and performance:
     - Design APIs to handle high-volume traffic and maintain low latency for inference requests.

6. **Monitoring and Observability**:
   - Monitor pipeline performance:
     - Use `Grafana` to visualize key metrics such as resource utilization and application health.
   - Define Service Level Objectives (SLOs):
     - Establish SLOs for critical metrics like latency, throughput, and error rates.
   - Track SLOs in `Grafana`:
     - Configure `Grafana` dashboards to monitor SLO metrics and set up alerts for violations.
