These are what I did to prepare for any MLE/DS/DA interviews. Even my scholarship interview tested Advanced SQL.

What I did to become an expert and solve any SQL question easily is to digest these notes then head to StrataScratch to keep practising the free Advanced SQL questions (in both SQL and Python - pandas).

Those few questions are sufficient, and I practise them once every few weeks to apply spaced repetition learning.

So I am always ready to solve an advanced SQL question anytime and anywhere.
