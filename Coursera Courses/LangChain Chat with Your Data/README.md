# LangChain: Chat With Your Data

*LangChain: Chat With Your Data* covers two main topics:

1. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** This is a common Large Language Model (LLM) application that retrieves contextual documents from an external dataset.

2. **Building a Chatbot:** This guide focuses on creating a chatbot that responds to queries based on the content of your documents, rather than the information it has learned during training.

During this course, you will learn about:

1. **Document Loading:** Understanding the fundamentals of data loading and exploring over 80 unique loaders that LangChain provides for accessing diverse data sources, including audio and video.

2. **Document Splitting:** Discovering the best practices and considerations for splitting data.

3. **Vector Stores and Embeddings:** Delving into the concept of embeddings and exploring vector store integrations within LangChain.

4. **Retrieval:** Grasping advanced techniques for accessing and indexing data in the vector store, enabling you to retrieve the most relevant information beyond semantic queries.

5. **Question Answering:** Building a one-pass question-answering solution.

6. **Chat:** Learning how to track and select pertinent information from conversations and data sources as you build your own chatbot using LangChain.

Start building practical applications that allow you to interact with data using LangChain and LLMs.
