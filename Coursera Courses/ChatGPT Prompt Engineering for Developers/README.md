# ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers

In *ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers*, you will learn how to utilize a large language model (LLM) to quickly build new and powerful applications. Through the OpenAI API, you'll gain the ability to create capabilities that innovate and provide value in ways that were previously cost-prohibitive, highly technical, or even impossible.

This short course, taught by Isa Fulford (OpenAI) and Andrew Ng (DeepLearning.AI), will explain how LLMs work, provide best practices for prompt engineering, and demonstrate how LLM APIs can be applied in various applications, including:

- **Summarizing:** For example, summarizing user reviews for brevity.
- **Inferring:** Such as sentiment classification and topic extraction.
- **Transforming Text:** Like translation and spelling/grammar correction.
- **Expanding Text:** Automatically generating emails.

Additionally, you'll learn two key principles for writing effective prompts, systematic prompt engineering, and how to build a custom chatbot.

All concepts are illustrated with numerous examples, and you can experiment with them directly in our Jupyter notebook environment to gain hands-on experience with prompt engineering.
