Hi, I'm documenting my quick notes

Please note that the notes here are not exhaustive—there’s a lot I’ve learned along the way that isn’t included, such as transfer learning, encoder-decoder architectures, U-Net, and more. These advanced concepts were covered during my Master’s in Computing, where I studied intensely to ensure I could understand and explain each concept clearly—even to a kid.

Even within my statistics notes, I’ve left out topics like unpooled variance cases, types of distributions, and other nuances. I’ll admit I don’t have everything memorized, but I’m confident I can speak to these topics effectively.

Some notes I’ve kept private, but what's here should be enough to prepare you well for most interviews. In fact, these very notes have helped me become a demanding interviewer myself.

These materials primarily focus on ML and DS fundamentals. Topics like MLOps, end-to-end pipelines, and related areas are things I picked up on the job through personal initiative—even though many rely on MLEs or SWE colleagues for them. It’s also how I picked up backend engineering skills, deployment in Kubernetes, and more.

As for SQL, I recommend reviewing the notes here and then heading over to StrataScratch to do the free advanced questions. These helped me confidently solve challenging SQL problems.

When it comes to LeetCode, I’ll be honest—I’m not the best yet, as I haven’t had time to fully grind. But if you’re looking to improve, just get NeetCode Premium. It’s significantly boosted my coding skills and logical thinking, even though I’m only halfway through. It helped me solve the YouTube Jane Street SWE interview problem with ease.
